====================================  docker  ======================================


docker-deamon : also known az "DOCKERD", it's the main component of docker due to it uses. it's a background service which manages docker containers images networks etc. that listens for docker api requests and so far. whenever we run a command in cli docker firstly sends that to the dockerd then will process our order, tutorials : 
				1. client run a command in terminal	
				2. docker cli sends a request to dockerd
				3. dockerd checks if NGINX image is available locally or not
					if yes : continue;
					else : pull the image from docker hub 
				4. dockerd creates and starts a container from the nginx image

!!! something should be noted that we're not connecting to dockerd through protocols like tcp,udp, etc. if we do "sudo nano systemctl.docker" on Service section there is a ExecStart var, it contains a command which is "-H fd://" it actually stands for "-HOST FILE DESCRIPTOR://"
we can also customize the dockerd, exp) if we wanna listen on tcp we just remove file descriptor and instead we use tcp://0.0.0.0:0 !!!!!



The diff between VM and docker containers : 
1. vms can have different os from the host but in containers host will share its os kernel with containers
2. vms will have a full os kernel, it's dependencies and it's applications etc. but containers will only include dependencies and it's applications so the system will not overhead or else.


docker-name : docker uses linux-name-spaces and cgroups
