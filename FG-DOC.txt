VDOM : fortigate devices has 2 types : 1.single-vdom-mode 2.multi-vdom-mode /// in case you want to check that what kind of device you have, just type this command in cli : "config vdom" if your device recognized it, then you have a multi-vdom-mode device and if it doesn't, then you have a single-vdom-mode device like FG30E

Admin profiles : by default we have 2 admin profiles : 1.super-admin(has full access kinda like root user, and CAN NOT BE CHANGED) 2.prof-admin (profile-administrator) ||| we use different profiles for assigning users to them / for example we have a admin-user which we don't want him to change some sort of things so you make a prof-admin with limited permissions and assign that profile to that user. 
!!!! NOTE : admin profiles as it name shows, DOES NOT effect users that has created locally. !!!!
